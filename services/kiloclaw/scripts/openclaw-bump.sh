# Deterministic OpenClaw version bump for the KiloClaw image.
#
# The GitHub job runs this. Given a target version it edits the pinned
# touchpoints, regenerates the lockfile, and opens a DRAFT PR.
#
# Create-once and terminal: it queries all PR states for the org-owned bump
# branch. If an open PR exists the script does not bump again; instead it reports
# how far that PR got so the caller can resume: action=resume-assessment when the
# assessment is still pending, resume-notify when it is written but Slack has not
# posted, skip-open-pr when it is fully done. A closed PR means the version was
# already proposed and is not recreated (override with BUMP_FORCE_RECREATE=true).
# A leftover branch with no PR is not auto-recovered; delete it and re-run, or set
# BUMP_FORCE_RECREATE=true to clear it. There is no force push. Pin consistency is
# validated by scripts/check-plugin-openclaw-pin.sh before publishing, and by CI.
#
# Usage:
#   services/kiloclaw/scripts/openclaw-bump.sh <TARGET_VERSION>
#   TARGET_VERSION env var is also accepted.
#
# Requires: bash, git, gh (authenticated), pnpm, node, sed. Run from a clean
# checkout of main.
#
# Env:
#   BUMP_ALLOW_DIRTY=true     local edits-only mode: edit + validate, never remote.
#   BUMP_SIGN_COMMITS=false   disable commit signing (default is to require it).
#   BUMP_FORCE_RECREATE=true  recreate even if a closed PR exists for the version,
#                             and clear a leftover branch instead of stopping.
#   NODE_OPTIONS              passed to the lockfile step; defaults to
#                             --max-old-space-size=6144 if unset.

## Summary

Bumps the packaged OpenClaw version in the KiloClaw image from ${CURRENT} to ${TARGET}: the
Dockerfile pin, the bundled plugin peer and dev deps, the lockfile, the e2e runbook version,
and a changelog entry. Prepared by automation.

## Verification

Validate per the kiloclaw-openclaw-upgrade skill before marking this PR ready:

- [ ] Run the local upgrade validation (one command): \`bash services/kiloclaw/scripts/tests/openclaw-upgrade-validate.sh\` — builds + keyless checks + grype CVE scan, then the credentialed live smoke (set \`KILOCODE_API_KEY\` for the smoke).
- [ ] Run the skill's final submission gates (typecheck, tests, lint) and review plugin diagnostics.
- [ ] Record the upgrade evidence (before and after versions, smoke result, any diagnostics) in this PR.
- [ ] Mark this PR ready once the above pass.
